# Thesis template

During my academic year at University Paris Dauphine PSL, I made a thesis (with LaTeX language).

I decided to release all the reusable elements of this thesis in order to offer this template for future students.

It's not an official or perfect template (or complete) but only a basic template to get started.

By starting LaTeX, I found examples too complicated or too simple. So, I decided not to use them and to start from scratch. This is why I suggest you discover the source code of this template.

I hope you would enjoy it too and that it will be useful to you.

Don't hesitate to contact me for any questions or suggestion. You can also open an issue or a pull request from GitHub directly to offer your improvements that will be used to improve this project.

❤️
